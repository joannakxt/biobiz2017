						<h2> CHAIRPERSON'S MESSAGE </h2>
						<p>
							<img src="img/chairman.png" id="chairimg" alt="Image">
							With a successful decade long track record of connecting the leaders of future with the leaders of today in biomedical industry, I am delighted to present to you - BioBiz 2017. Every year in Singapore, BioBiz provides a platform for both the biomedical industry and the young talents from universities to find the right employee and the right employer, respectively. By bringing the key players in the biomedical industry and budding talents together, BioBiz has become the bridge that makes "supply meet demand" in Singapore's biomedical industry.
							<br><br>
							With growing participation from previous years, BioBiz 2017 is going to be even more exciting and fruitful for both the talents and talent hunters in biomedical arena. Building on previous years' success, we aim to expand our platform from a specialized niche in biomedical sciences to a wider one, incorporating biotechnology and medical technology industries. Along with the enthusiasm we have witnessed from undergraduates over the years, we foresee a higher participation by university postgraduates, polytechnic and ITE graduates, as we align ourselves with Skills Future Mission of Singapore, by holding parallel sessions for polytechnic and ITE audience and by expanding ourselves into R&D, healthcare and medical technology areas. This will provide specialists as well as technicians to the industries as well as a chance to propel the mission of building a skilled workforce in Singapore.
							<br><br>
							At a time when Singapore's world-class biomedical industry is driven by interdisciplinary knowledge, it is imperative that multidisciplinary talents converge and connect. Innovation in research, development and manufacturing of biomedical products has been a result of the synergistic efforts from cross-field experts working together. We aim to bring this fact to the attention of prospective biomedical talents through lively discussion sessions by field experts and key stakeholders, and also by displaying the traditional and novel jobs available in biomedical industry. At BioBiz 2017, our primary focus would be to provide participating companies with easier access to a wider pool of talents with varied backgrounds for the industries, while at the same time inciting a greater understanding of the existing career opportunities among the talents.
							<br><br>
							I believe, by bringing Singapore's best talents and top industrial players together, BioBiz 2017 presents the best platform for all involved - for companies to showcase their opportunities and for talents to unveil their potential, accelerating Singapore's vision for a strong workforce to push the horizon of biomedical industries in Singapore.
